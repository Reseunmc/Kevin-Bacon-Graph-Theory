This software uses breadth-first search (BFS) to conduct social network analysis in a variation on the "Kevin Bacon game". The goal in the Kevin Bacon Game is to find the shortest path between two actors by connecting them with other actors who worked togeter in movies. The vertices are actors and the edge relationship is "appeared together in a movie". The number of edges to/ from a vertex is thus the degrees of separation. 
Given a root, the BFS builds a shortest-path tree from every vertex that can reach back to the root. In this tree, every vertex points to its parent, and the parent is the next vertex in a shortest path to the root. This software stores the tree as a directed graph. Once the tree is built, the software allows you to find the vertex for a person of interest and follow the edes back to the root, tracking edge labels and vertices along the path.
